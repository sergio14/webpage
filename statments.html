				In 2001 I finished my community college studies and graduated as agricultural technician. By that time, I began with my earliest research studies focused on the analysis of crop yields. In 2002, I started my studies at the Universidad Nacional de Misiones. Since then, I have developed a strong interest in biological data analysis (BS in genetics). In order to gain laboratory experience, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant performing genetic and epidemiological analysis of reemerging viruses. In 2007, I moved to Buenos Aires to began my Bachelor Thesis work. To this end, I joined the Structural Immunology Laboratory at the Fundación Instituto Leloir. My research in this laboratory was focused on two edges: one was oriented to the cloning, expression, purification, in vitro refolding, and biophysical characterization of primary antibodies. The other, addressed the use of bioinformatic tools in the analysis of immunoglobulin genes data. Working at this laboratory allowed me to acquire training in protein handling and purification, as well as in the analysis and interpretation of results. In mid-2008 I joined the Molecular Virology laboratory at the Fundación Instituto Leloir. Firstly I did short term training and in 2010 I began to study for my PhD in Molecular Virology at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. During this time, I was awarded a one-year Graduate Student Research Grant by the European Union, and then CONICET (National Council of Research and Technology) awarded me a five-year grant. The main goal of my research is oriented to understand the role of RNA structures present in the dengue virus genome during each step of the viral cycle (virus replication between mammalian and mosquito cells). To this end, I did intensive training in the analysis of data obtained from microscopy, biochemical probing, fluorescence, cell culture and deep sequencing.

				With the objective to gain tools and expertise in the analysis of next generation sequencing data, between 2011 and 2012 I did two internships at the University of California, San Francisco, and started a Master’s degree in Data Mining at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. I focused my Master’s thesis on the use of appropriate algorithms to overcome problems associated with the high noise error of deep sequencing data. Therefore, I was able to develop an automatic approach to detect viral variants with frequencies lower than 1% within virus populations. As a result of my hard work and enthusiasm, while doing my MS and PhD I gained valuable experience in statistics, algebra and machine learning. Nowadays, I´m interested in expanding beyond this area, because I’m aware of the importance of applying my skills within other fields outside academic science. Recently, I was awarded an honors mention in the first hackaton "Buenos Aires verde 2014". For this challenge, I developed a regression model to predict with high accuracy the levels of waste produced by the city. In addition, last October as part of a team I got a special mention in the "hackaton AGRODATOS" organized by the National Ministry of Science and the Sadosky Foundation. This time, we developed a statistical model to predict the yields of crop fields in the south of Buenos Aires Province. At present, I’m developing personal projects aimed at gaining expertise in customized product recommendation, social networks analysis, digital surveillance and information visualization.

 Nowadays, I´m interested in expanding my frontiers, so I realized the importance of applying my skills within others fields outside academic science.
  During the last year, I got the third place in the analytics challenge of the first Buenos Aires verde hackaton. In this challenge, 
  I developed a model to predict the levels of waste produced by companies around the city. 
  The last October, as  part of a workgroup we won a special mention on the first AGRODATOS hackaton organized by the National 
  Ministry of Science and the Sadosky foundation. This time, we developed a statistical model to predict cereal crop fields yields 
  in the south of Buenos Aires. At the present, I’m performing personal projects addressed to gain expertise in personalized product recommendation, 
  social networks analysis, digital surveillance and information visualization.
